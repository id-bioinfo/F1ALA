# TIPars2: An ultrafast and memory-efficient ancestral lineage annotator for huge SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny using F1-score

The unprecedented scale of the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny overwhelmed most common ancestral lineage annotation methods (such as matUtils and PastML) when inferring the PANGO lineage information to a rooted tree with labeled taxa. Furthermore, the accuracy of these annotation methods has not been clearly elucidated. To resolve these challenges, we developed an efficient and accurate ancestral lineage annotation method (TIPars2) utilizing F1-score to evaluate the confidence for assigning a lineage annotation at a specific ancestor node using taxa lineage labels. TIPars2 achieved ultrafast speed (less than 13 minutes) with significant less memory usage (3.6 GB) for annotating 2,277 PANGO lineages in a phylogeny with 5.26 million taxa, allowing real-time lineage tracking to be performed on a laptop computer. Benchmarking on three phylogenies with 100K, 660K and 5.26M taxa, TIPars2 significantly outperformed matUtils and was comparable to PastML on the annotation accuracy in both empirical and simulated tests. The high efficiency of TIPars2 enables the refinement of a huge SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny by pruning all taxa with inconsistent label compared to their closest annotated ancestors and re-inserting them back. We demonstrated that this refinement was able to optimize the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree topology achieving a larger tree log-likelihood and a smaller parsimony score.

# How It Works 

<img src="/img/illustration.png" width="600">
Illustration of the algorithm for ancestral lineage annotation. Given a tree with 5 taxa (Node5-9) and 4 internal nodes (Node1-4) where Node5-7 are labeled lineage A and Node8-9 are labeled lineage B, ancestral lineage annotation is computed in three steps. Step1: Extract potential annotated ancestor nodes for lineage A (Node1-3 and 5-7) and B (Node1, 3-4 and 8-9) (shown in the headers (black background) of top two tables). Step2: Determine the order of lineages to assign the annotation based on the annotation confidence score (the largest F1-score in each lineage, i.e., A = 4/5 and B = 1, marked by underlines in top two tables). It is first to assign lineage B and then A. The order is shown as ① and ② in bottom two tables. Step3: Assign the annotation for B at Node4 firstly (middle table), then for A at Node1. When recalculating F1-scores for potential annotated ancestor nodes of lineage A, taxa Node8-9 are excluded due to taxa Node8-9 have been assigned to the confirmed annotation of Node4 in the previous processing (bottom table). Note that F1-score tables for lineage B are the same in Step1 and Step3 shown in the middle.

# Installation

A precompiled executable program is available as TIPars2.jar (required Java 11 or above). 

For users to compile TIPars2 source code from GitHub, 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/id-bioinfo/TIPars2.git
cd TIPars2
make
```

For conda installation, 
```bash
conda create -n tipars
conda activate tipars
conda config --add channels yongtaotipars
conda install tipars2
```

# Quick Usage

## Pango lineage annotation

```bash
cd /home/ytye/tipars2_github/Benchmark_datasets/100k
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --annotation -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk --label 100k_pangolin.tsv  --output 1248_in_100k_annotation.tsv -T 8 
```

## Annotation statistics and visualization 

```bash
cd /home/ytye/tipars2_github/Benchmark_datasets/100k
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --annotation_details -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk --label 100k_pangolin.tsv --assignment 1248_in_100k_annotation.tsv --output 1248_in_100k_annotation_details.tsv -T 8
```

+ Write the annotation details to the output file, including annotated_node, annotated_node_precedor, distance_to_root, pangolineage, F1score and samples.
+ Write the annotation visualization to file graph-data-generated.js that should be moved to the provided 'visual' folder and open the 'graph.html' in a browser.
+ Collapse the tree by lineages and write this collapsed tree to file [#lineages]_collapsedTree.nwk.
+ Remove inconsistent taxa and write this pruned tree to file [#consistent_taxa]_removedTree.nwk (used for tree refinement using other phylogenetic insertion methods, e.g., UShER).
+ Write the inconsistent taxa names and their lineages to file [#inconsistent_taxa]_unKeepSamples_[#consistent_taxa]_tree.tsv.

## Tree refinement
### Phylogenetic insertion using TIPars
+ include processing tree annotation
```bash
cd /home/ytye/tipars2_github/Benchmark_datasets/100k
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --refinement -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk -s 100k_taxa.fas -a 100k_anc.fas --label 100k_pangolin.tsv --output refined_tree.nwk -T 8 -x 8G
```

+  exclude processing tree annotation that could be computed by other methods, e.g. PastML and matUtils
```bash
cd /home/ytye/tipars2_github/Benchmark_datasets/100k
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --refinement_from_annotation -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk -s 100k_taxa.fas -a 100k_anc.fas --label 100k_pangolin.tsv --assignment 1248_in_100k_annotation.tsv --output refined_tree.nwk -T 8 -x 8G
```

### Phylogenetic insertion using UShER 
+  use the [#consistent_taxa]_removedTree.nwk after tree annotation by TIPars2
```bash
cd /home/ytye/tipars2_github/Benchmark_datasets/100k
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --annotation -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk --label 100k_pangolin.tsv  --output 1248_in_100k_annotation.tsv -T 8
/home/ytye/tipars2_github/tipars2 --annotation_details -t 100k_tree_InnodeNameAdded.nwk --label 100k_pangolin.tsv --assignment 1248_in_100k_annotation.tsv --output 1248_in_100k_annotation_details.tsv -T 8
usher -v taxa.vcf -t 81784_removedTree.tree -d ./usher -o ./usher/81784_AddTo_100k.pb
```
+ The refined tree by UShER is ./usher/final-tree.nh.
